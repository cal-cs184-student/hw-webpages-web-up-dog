		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>In this project, we built a cloth simulation from the ground up by modeling it as a mass-spring system and exploring how it behaves under different physical forces and constraints. We started by setting up the cloth structure using various types of springs—structural, shearing, and blending—and visualized how the setup changes its shape and density. Then, we brought the cloth to life through simulation, experimenting with different values for stiffness, density, and damping to see how they affect the way the cloth moves, settles, and interacts with gravity. We added collision handling with spheres and planes, and later, self-collision detection to make sure the cloth wouldn’t unrealistically pass through itself. On the graphics side, we implemented Blinn-Phong shading for more realistic lighting, added texture mapping, and compared bump and displacement mapping to see how they change surface detail. One thing that stood out to me was how much small changes in parameters—whether physical or visual—can completely change how realistic and dynamic the simulation feels. It really highlighted how physics and rendering work hand-in-hand in graphics.</p>

		<figcaption><b>No Shearing (Structural & Blending)</b></figcaption>
		<p>The cloth forms a perfect rectangular lattice, with horizontal / vertical edges plus the longer 2-hop

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		We tested how different parameters affect the cloth dropping animations.
		<p>
			For <b>Stiffness - <code>ks</code></b>, I tested the paramter over the values of 100, 5000, 25000, and we
			saw the different stiffness demonstrated in the rendering and animation.
		</p>
		<p>Small <code>ks</code> (soft cloth with low stiffness): we can see the sag (arc) between pinned corners is
			tighter with smaller radius of curvature as the midpoint drops a lot eventually.</p>
		<p>When the cloth eventually falls down or during falling, there are many large amplitude folding and ripples
			throughout, including the lower half.</p>
		<p>During the settling phase after the cloth falls down, there are many gentle oscillations persisting for a
			while, almost looking like as if it keeps stretching after fallen.</p>

		<p>Medium <code>ks</code> (intermediate-soft cloth with medium stiffness): we can see the sag (arc) between
			pinned
			corners is
			more natural with the radius being intermediate between the two extremes.</p>
		<p>When the cloth eventually falls down or during falling, there are still smome folding and ripples
			throughout, including the lower half, but significantly smaller than in the soft (small <code>ks</code>)
			case.</p>
		<p>During the settling phase after the cloth falls down, there are still mild oscillations persisting for a
			while, but rests much faster than the previous case and with smaller amplitude.</p>

		<p>Large <code>ks</code> (hard cloth with high stiffness): we can see the sag (arc) between pinned corners is

		<p>When the cloth eventually falls down or during falling, there are barely any folding and ripples
			throughout, and the surface looks taut.</p>
		<p>During the settling phase after the cloth falls down, there are barely any oscillations persisting over time,
			and rests much faster into stationary place with almost no visible swinging.</p>

			saw the different damping effects demonstrated in the rendering and animation.
		</p>
		<p>Small <code>damping</code> same rest shape as default as damping does not affect the equilibrium state, but

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<b>Collisions with Sphere: </b>
		<p>Computer \(dir = pm.position - origin\) and compare if \(dir \le radius\), then the point mass is inside or
			on the sphere, then target the surface point \(spherePos = origin + dir.unit() \times radius\) with partial
			corrections \(pm.postion = pm.\text{last_position} \times (1 - frictino) \times (spherePos -
			pm.\text{last_position})\). </p>
		<p>The multiplication with \((1 - friction)\) prevents the mass from fully snapping to the
			surface of the shere and to preserve some of the tangential motion it has. And unlike the plane
			implementation, there is lacking of the tiny pushouts of <code>SURFACE_OFFSET</code> so the repenetration of
			it could happen if velocity points back inside the sphere.
		</p>



		<b>Collisions with Plane: </b>
		<p>Computes signed distances of current and the last of the point to the plane \((n \cdot
			x + h = 0)\). Then a collision occurs if signs differ.</p>
		<p>Then, for both of them, we simply loop ove rall collision objects and call collide for every PointMass, so
			the
			cloth now drapes over spheres and stops at planes before the self-collision implementation in part 4.</p>
		<p>Compute the signed distances to the plane \(n \cdot (x - point)\) at both old and new positions, and if the
			product is negative, i.e., \(\text{last_dist} \times \text{cur_dist} \le 0\), the line segment in between
			crosses the plane.</p>
		<p> Then we find the time of intersection, \(t = \frac{\text{last_dist}}{\text{last_dist} -
			pm.position}\), resulting in a fraction in the range of [0,1] which indicates where the plane is hit:
			\(pm.\text{last_position} \rightarrow pm.position\). </p>
		<p>And to prevent cloth overlapping the space with the
			plane, we add a normal \(normal \times \text{SURFACE_OFFSET}\) to stay just above the plane, then
			multiple by \((1 - friction)\) to retain lateral motion, allowing for cloth sliding activities.</p>
		<p>.</p>
		<p>.</p>



		<p>Small <code>ks</code> (soft cloth
			with low stiffness): we can see the cloth sags deeply and clings to the
			sphere closer while pooling at the equator, with large folds cascading down the sides, and excess fabric
			gathering near the bottom, forming many wrinkles.</p>
		<p>This is mainly because the low stiffness lets gravity stretch the mesh more easily, with contact forces
			pushing nmasses outward till springs equilibrate, so it conforms tightly and wrinkles easily.</p>
		<img src="images/part3/sphere_ks_500.png" width="800px" />
		<p>.</p>
		<p>.</p>


		<p>Medium <code>ks</code> (intermediate-soft cloth with medium stiffness): we can see the cloth drapes over
			the
			sphere with moderate folds diminishing towards the lower rim.</p>
		<p>This is because springs are stronger and able to resist more extreme stretching but still let the cloth
			settle into concave regions..</p>
		<img src="images/part3/sphere_ks_5000.png" width="800px" />
		<p>.</p>
		<p>.</p>


		<p>Large <code>ks</code> (hard cloth with high stiffness): we can see the cloth baerly sags and touches the
			sphere shallowly with barely any deformations, with the surface looking taut with smalle folds and
			wrinkles,
			but most noticeably is its edges hover.</p>
		<p>This is mainly because the high stiffness counteracts gravity quickly, and having small correction
			vectors
			from the sphere, so only nearby masses reach contact before network stops stretching.</p>
		<img src="images/part3/sphere_ks_50000.png" width="800px" />
		<p>.</p>
		<p>.</p>


		<p>Below is a screenshot of the cloth laying on the plane.</p>
		<img src="images/part3/plane.png" width="800px" />



		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<p>Self-collisions is achieved with the 3 functions we modified.</p>
		<p>First, with <code>hash_positions</code>, which maps 3d point to hashkey representing a spatial bin of 3x3x3
			cubic cm like box, we scale the cloth's x, y, z extents into integer grid coordinates,
			then pack them into a 32 bit integer and cast to float so it can be used as an <code>unorderd_map</code>
			key.</p>
		<p>Then, weith <code>bulid_spatial_map</code>, which we calls and rebuild the hash table at each time step, we
			clear the map and for every <code>PointMass</code>, we co,pute
			a key, then push into that bucket's vector a pointer.</p>
		<p>Eventually, with <code>self_collide</code>, which push a single <code>PointMass</code> out of its neighbors
			if too close, we fetch the bucket for <code>pm</code>, then for every other <code>PointMass</code> in the
			same bucket,
			measure distance <code>d</code>, eventually when \(d \le 2 \cdot \text{thickness}\), we aggregate a
			correction so the pair will be exactly 2 times thickness apart, and eventually with all the corrections, we
			can average them then divide by <code>simlutaion_steps</code> and add to <code>pm.position</code> unless the
			cloth is pinned.</p>


		<p>.</p>
		<p>.</p>
		<p>Below are screenshots that document how your cloth falls and folds on itself, starting with an early, initial
			self-collision and ending with the cloth at a more restful state (even if it is still slightly bouncy on the
			ground).</p>

		<h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
		<p>
			<li>What is a shader program?</li>
			<li>How do vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material
				effects?</li>
		</p>

		<h3>Blinn-Phong Shading</h3>
		<p>As seen in lecture, the Blinn-Phong shading model is a shading method used to simulate
			realistic
			lighting on
			surfaces by combining three main components: ambient, diffuse, and specular. The ambient
			term
			provides a
			constant base illumination independent of the light direction, represented by \(k_a \times
			I_a\),
			while the
			diffuse term calculates how light is scattered when it hits a surface based on the angle
			between the
			surface
			normal and the light direction, using \(k_d \times (I/r^2) \times \max(0, n \cdot l)\).
			Additionally, the
			specular term adds a shiny highlight by computing the reflection of light based on the
			half-vector
			between
			the light and view directions, expressed as \(k_s \times (I/r^2) \times \max(0, n \cdot
			h)^p\). In
			our code,
			these components are implemented by normalizing the necessary vectors, computing the squared
			distance
			\(r^2\), and then summing the three contributions to determine the final color output,
			resulting in
			realistic highlights and shading effects on the cloth + sphere!</p>
		<p>We can see Phong shading in action below with just its individual components and also with
			all three
			components together. When combined, we get a nice, realistic rendering of the cloth +
			sphere.</p>

		<h3>Texture Mapping</h3>
		<p>Here is the result of using texture mapping shader on the cloth simulation but with a picture
			of a
			pug!</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

						<img src="images/part5/texture.png" width="700px" />
						<figcaption>Image of a pug on a cloth draping over a sphere</figcaption>

		</div>

		<h3>Bump Mapping and Displacement Mapping</h3>
		<p>Bump mapping and displacement mapping are two techniques for adding surface detail using
			height maps,
			but
			they differ in how they affect the final render. Bump mapping modifies only the normals by
			computing
			changes
			in height over the texture coordinates, resulting in variations in lighting that simulate
			surface
			irregularities without actually changing the geometry; this makes it computationally
			efficient while
			maintaining the original silhouette of the object. In contrast, displacement mapping goes a
			step
			further by
			altering the actual vertex positions based on the height map (i.e., \(p' = p + n \times
			h(u,v)
			\times
			k_h\)), which leads to real geometric deformation that affects the object's outline and can
			produce
			more
			convincing results.</p>
		<p>In the renderings below, we can see that with bump mapping, the cloth is more smooth and with
			displacement
			mapping, the cloth is more bumpy. This is expected as bump mapping changes the normals,
			while
			displacement
			mapping modifies the vertex positions, changing the overall shape of the sphere.</p>

		<h4>Mesh coarseness: <code>-o 16 -a 16</code></h4>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

						<figcaption>Bump mapping (-o 16 -a 16)</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">

						<figcaption>Displacement mapping (-o 16 -a 16)</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h4>Mesh coarseness: <code>-o 128 -a 128</code></h4>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="images/part5/bump_128.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption>Bump mapping (-o 128 -a 128)</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="images/part5/displacement_128.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption>Displacement mapping (-o 128 -a 128)</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>		
		<p>We can also change the coarsness of the mesh and compare both bump mapping and displacement
			mapping.
			We can
			see that with the coarser grid (-o 16 -a 16), we get a bumpier sphere for displacement
			mapping. On
			the other
			hand, with a finer grid (-o 128 -a 128), we get a smoother overall sphere for displacement
			mapping.
			The bump
			mapping for both spheres appear to be quite similar or even identical because the coarseness
			does
			not really
			affect the appearance of the sphere.</p>
